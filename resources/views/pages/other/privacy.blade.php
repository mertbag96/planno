                <h1>Planno's Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>
                    This privacy policy ("Policy") informs you of our practices when handling your Information
                    through the Services (both as defined below). In this Policy, "Planno," "we," "our" or "us" refers
                    to Planno Inc. When you are using Planno Services in your personal capacity, we are the data
                    controller under the applicable privacy laws, and this Policy applies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you are using Planno Services as a member of an organization that is a customer of Planno
                    (for example, when accessing a Planno for teams workspace that relates to your employer if that
                    employer is a Planno customer), we are a data processor under the applicable privacy laws, and that
                    organization is the data controller. In those circumstances, your organization's privacy policy
                    applies, and you should refer to its privacy policy for information about its privacy practices.
                    For clarity, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please be aware
                    that this Policy does not apply to your activities or any Information that you disclose to your
                    organization, when that organization is the data controller.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the purpose of this Policy, "Information" means any information relating to an identified or
                    identifiable individual. This includes information you provide or generated when you use: (a) our
                    apps, including Planno; and (b) planno.com. When you use the Services, you accept and understand
                    we collect, process, use and store your Information as described in this Policy.
                    <strong>
                        If you do not agree with this Policy, you must not use any of the Services. If you change your
                        mind in the future, you must stop using the Services and you may exercise your rights in relation
                        to your Information as set out in this Policy.
